Apparently broke spawning if containers aren't kept in rooms. Look into how to break out of miner spawn loop if no containers
Look into creepsInRoom issue
Clean up spawn logic for role types vs game state
Fix tower code for multiple rooms

- Create better spawn rules for harvester parts build
  - Create line for find dropped energy if source is empty
- Improve tower AI
