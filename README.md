Very much a work in progress.

Many thanks to th_Pion for the tutorial videos that are helping us learn how to
  do this. Visit his repository to learn more.

Be sure to add the minCreeps object to your spawn memory. Fill the object with
  roleName: numOfCreeps values to set minimums of roles. Ex = harvester = 2

Current features:
- Multi-room control
  - Claimer role included. Initiate by adding target: [roomName] to spawn memory
- Container harvesting for gathering efficiency
- Comments galore for easy understanding
